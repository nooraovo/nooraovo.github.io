short_bio: |
  Hi! I'm Shuning Shang, an incoming CS Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/"> Princeton University </a>. Previously, I studied CS at <a href="https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/"> Zhejiang University </a> with honors from <a href="http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/"> Chu Kochen Honors College </a>.<br><br>
  
  My research interest lies in machine learning theory, especially understanding the training dynamics and generalization for LLM and other modern AI models. I hope to bridge the gap between theory and practice in ML by designing efficient algorithms and gaining insights into their underlying principles. I was very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://difanzou.github.io/"> Prof. Difan Zou </a> from the University of Hong Kong and <a href="https://weihu.me/"> Prof. Wei Hu </a> from the University of Michigan. Meanwhile, I also feel lucky to cooperate with <a href="https://zhiweixx.github.io/"> Zhiwei Xu </a> and <a href="https://xuranmeng.github.io/"> Xuran Meng </a> from Umich.<br><br>
 
  In my spare time, I like listening to music(pop&classic), baking, and playing the piano. If you find similar interests with me, feel free to contact!
