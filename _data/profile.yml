short_bio: |
  Hi! I'm Shuning Shang, a senior from Zhejiang University, Chukochen Honors College. I major in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics.
  My research interest lies in machine learning theory, especially the foundations and principles of deep learning. I believe we can use mathematical tools to explore the "Black Box" of AI, and then fully unlock its potential. Currently, I'm very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Difan Zou from the University of Hong Kong to do research on deep learning theory. During 2024 summer, I had the privilege of undertaking a research internship on relevant topics under the guidance of Prof. Wei Hu at the University of Michigan. Meanwhile, I also feel lucky to cooperate with Zhiwei Xu and Xuran Meng from Umich.
  In my spare time, I like listening to music(pop&classic), baking, and playing the piano. If you find similar interests with me, feel free to contact!
